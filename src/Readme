This folder contains all the files for each code
Every file will run in the jupter notebook, therefore please use them in google colab and similar env.

For each type of feature there are two different code files one for classification and one for regression

4.1 (a) (classification) : Relevance News Category Features
4.1 (a) Regression : Relevance News Category Features

4.1 (b) (classification) : Named Entity Features
4.1 (b) (Regression) : Named Entity Features

4.1 (c) (classification) : Richness Post Type Features
4.1 (c) (Regression) : Richness Post Type Features

4.1 (d) (classification) : Linguistics Style Features
4.1 (d) (Regression) : Linguistics Style Features


4.1 (e) (classification) : Emotional Salience Features
4.1 (e) (Regression) : Emotional Salience Features

All_Feature_Classification.ipynb : Combines all the features and then run classification
All_Feature_Regression.ipynb : Combines all the features and then run regression

Regarding main.py and main.ipynb : It is advised not to run before changing appropriate location for each file and model. Else the code is fine.
Most preferred method is to run them individual for more clear picture for each feature

Detailed report is updates on the google classroom
